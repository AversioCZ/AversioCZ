I’m @AversioCZ 

I’m interested in Computational design, BIM and AEC design automatization.
I believe in opensource and collaboration and the idea of OpenBIM.

My github is focusing on small tools which are user PC based and without installation so users can leverage the pluses of BIM and try the principles without buying complex expensive AEC tools.

My primary skills are Revit, Dynamo, Grasshopper nad basics of python. If you feel you can help with some of my project feel free to do so.
